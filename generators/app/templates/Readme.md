# Welcome to <%= theme %>

<%= theme %> is a responsive <%= cms %> theme for <%= client %>. <%= description %>

@author: <%= author %> and friends at Echo & Co., http://echo.co

It uses a few core tools:

* Grunt, http://gruntjs.com - A javascript (node) task runner
    * Used to compile everything (compile things, optimize things, copy things, etc.)
    * See comments at the top of '/Gruntfile.js' for installation info
* Libsass, http://sass-lang.com/libsass - a very fast CSS precompiler
    * Runs through the grunt-node-sass wrapper
    * After Grunt installation, run 'grunt css' to compile your scss to css once, and 'grunt watch' to compile on save
* Autoprefixer, https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer - postcss plugin to automatically apply vendor prefixes depending on browser support.
    * see the autoprefix task in /config/css.js for specific browser support
* Bower, http://bower.io/ - a front-end package manager
    * Used to download all front-end vendor or plugin scripts (chosen.js, enquire.js, fitvids.js, etc.)
    * Using the Grunt-bower-concat plugin (in /config/javascript.js), grunt will automatically extract and concatenate all necessary scripts and css from /bower_components. You can declare dependencies here as well to force proper ordering.
    * Any files that are not css or js are copied over individually (mainly images).
    * Jquery and Mondernizr are handled outside of bower. Jquery typically comes with a CMS, and modernizr requires a custom build downloaded directly from their website.
